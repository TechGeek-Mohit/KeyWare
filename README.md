# KeyWare-Password-Manager
Computers and the Internet have become essential tools for business, education, entertainment, and so many other facets of daily life. The multitude of accounts required to utilize online services or computer applications can cause users to choose easily memorable passwords, or simply reuse old passwords. These passwords can also be stored in an unsafe manner, introducing many vulnerabilities into a user’s personal information. Strong cyber security is paramount in protecting these passwords, login credentials, and the sensitive information locked behind them. As data breaches and online security compromises become more common in the digital age, the risk of sensitive information being leaked requires better solutions for protecting user data. Password managers can be useful in creating more secure passwords and safely storing them, although current password manager solutions are still at risk from using weak methods to encrypt the user data, and the developers having access to a user’s information. An improved password manager should be developed that is easy to use, supports the creation of secure random passwords, and utilizes strong encryption of passwords.
